Here are a few observations based on the data report.

As one may expect, the player population base is overwhelmingly
majority male, but females actually have higher values for average
purchase price and average total purchase per person.

Another interesting and unexpected observation is that among the age 
demographics of players, the age range for players under the age of 10 
and age range 35-39 make up a small percentage of players but have the 
highest values for average purchase price and average total purchase
per person (perhaps parents are playing with their kids 
and buying items for the kids).

These observations can perhaps suggest how the game company can
focus advertising on certain demographics. As a free-to-play game,
it is important to increase the player base, but ultimately
profit is generated from players who are willing to spend money 
on in-game content. Contrary to what we may expect from gaming culture,
we observe that females are just as committed and invested in the game, and
are spending money on in-game items. We also observe potential for
higher profits in unexpected age ranges as well.

In the data analysis of in-game purchased items, the top 10 most 
profitable items were somewhere within the $4 range and had a purchase count 
of at least 7. There was one specific item with a purchase count of 8 but the
purchase price was only $1.02. Perhaps the company should revalue
and increase the cost of some of the items with high purchase counts
but low cost considering many other items with high purchase counts 
were closer to $4.
